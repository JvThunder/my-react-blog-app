Recently I've been contemplating on what's the best path to do greatness, after seeing many people having successes in different ways. Many people believe that gaining capital as early as possible and as much as possible is probably the best policy in life. 

Well it's no wonder that a lot of my smart friends then continue to aim for quant companies. Some do succeed and got insane amounts of pay. Sometimes that makes me jealous and contemplate why dont I try to go for it. Coming from a background in math and informatics olympiad, I am quite confident that if I really dedicate 1-2 years of my life on this, I could probably ace the questions and interviews quant companies give (I hope this doesn't come off as bragging)

But then another part of me starts to think, it it really the best path for me? Well, first of all, I'm not so interested in the works quant do. I personally think they aren't contributing to society in meaningful way. I can't do great work directly from this field. But some may argue that you can do a lot with that amount of money, even after just working 3-4 years in the quant industry. 

So I thought to myself, is it better to be a millionaire with no direct applicable skills, or become the top 0.1% in your field. (well technically for quant the skills you get is being very good at low level programming and financial math, both of which is very hard but not so transferable) Some might choose the former. But I would argue that in terms of pursuing greatness, the latter might be more important. Just like money can compound, so does your skills and expertise.

I'm pretty sure that even if I get 1 million dollars now, I don't know what good thing I can do directly. I can technically give to charity, but that would be limited and is probably a one off thing. I could probably start a company, but without expertise, I don't really know what kind of business to do. I'm leaning more towards building deep tech companies that can bring value to society. I may hire expertise and start a company, but what direction should I pursue if I am not confident in the field? And honestly I don't want to just be an investor, I want to build things too!

On the other hand, if I do become one of the top researcher/practioner in a field, I can imagine more things that I can possibly contribute to. Maybe along the way, I might find like minded people to build amazing AI products for society. Maybe some research I've made turns out to be an important work that would later on be adopted, like the transformers paper. Maybe I can be a professor at the top universities leading people to do more great work and pursue their dreams. Of course, just like many other events in life, this would probably require some good amount of luck. But in some way, I can vision this path to be a better one towards greatness.

For those of you who don't care about doing great work and just want a simple life with happy family, this might look silly and idealistic, maybe even sounds like a child-like dream, and honestly, you might be right. Also I think that this is a perfectly valid way of living and I respect everyone pursuing this. (honestly I would probably have lesser internal conflict if I pursue this path, but unfortunately that's not how my brain works) I may not be there yet, but I truly believe in whatever I'm writing. DISCLAIMER: I can also write this because I feel content with my life now in terms of finances, I don't feel external pressure or circumstances for gaining money as fast as possible, and I always feel the blessings Jesus gives to my life. I believe that whatever I receive, may it be power, status or wealth, comes from Him and should be used for His glory. So even if I am rich, I would not use money for myself.

I think I will continue to pursue my path, towards becoming a great AI researcher. I especially concerned of the future of AI and I hope that I can help nudge the needle towards a safer AI for social good, and not just for the elites. I think this is my ikigai, and my calling, and I will start focusing on this. I realize that most people of greatness, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jensen Huang, Demis Hassabis, have similar traits: they are disciplined, focused, stick to their principles and are really good in what they are doing.

Well, this is more of a rant and my chain of thought reasoning, but this serves as my personal journal for the future me but hopefully it will be the inspiration for many others too. So for those of you who wants to do great work, let us focus on doing what is important and impactful, to not be swayed and distracted by others who have different goals. For the Christians out there, remember to always focus on serving others, and building God's kingdom and glory, more than our own personal gains. "If you can do it now, then why aren't you solving the most important problems the world has to offer?" I hope we can all meet at the top. :)
