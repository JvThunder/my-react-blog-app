Recently, I've been contemplating what the best path to achieving greatness really is, especially after seeing people succeed in so many different ways. (Note that the path towards greatness is not necessarily the path towards becoming a billionaire, but it is a path towards doing great work and making a difference in the world) A lot of people believe that gaining capital as early and as much as possible is probably the best policy in life.

It's no wonder, then, that many of my smart friends aim for quant companies. Some succeed and end up earning insane amounts of money (for context, the highest salary I know of is around **$200k/year** even for interns, crazy, I know). Sometimes that makes me jealous, and I find myself wondering: why don't I try going for it too? Coming from a background of winning multiple national and international Math and Coding Olympiads at school, I feel confident that if I dedicated fully grinding for 2-3 years of my life to preparing, I could probably ace the questions and interviews quant companies give, and maybe have a somewhat decent chance of getting onboard. (I hope this does not come off as bragging and I only intend to use this for my argument)

But then another part of me starts to question: Would that really be the best path for me? Is that *really* what I want? For one, I'm not particularly interested in the work quants do. Personally, I don't think it contributes to society in a very meaningful way. I don't see myself doing great work directly in that field. Of course, some would argue that with the kind of money you can make, even after just 3-4 years in the quant industry, you could do a lot of good.

So I thought to myself: is it better to be a millionaire with no directly applicable skills, or to become part of the top 1% in your field? (Well, technically quants do gain strong skills in low-level programming and/or advanced financial math, both very difficult, but arguably not so transferable) Some might choose the former. But I would argue that, when it comes to pursuing greatness, the latter matters more. Just as money can compound, so can skills and expertise.

**Disclaimer:** *I can write this from a place of contentment. Financially, although I am not from a rich family background even in Indonesian standards, I feel secure and don't have external pressure to chase money as quickly as possible. More importantly, I constantly feel the blessings Jesus gives in my life. I believe that whatever I receive, be it power, status, or wealth, ultimately comes from Him and should be used for His glory. Even if I were to become rich, I wouldn't use money just for myself, and I hope I can continue to live quite modestly.*

People say I can do what I love when I have money, but is money really the only thing stopping me do what I really want to do now? Like I said, I feel content with how I live now, so why wait to do what I want in the first place? Even if I would have a million dollars by then, I might not be sure what good I could directly do with it. Sure, I could donate to charity, but that is limited and probably a one-off thing. I could try starting a company, but without deep expertise, I would not really know what kind of business to build. I wouldn't want to retire early either, and that is never the point of doing great work. Personally, I lean toward building deep tech companies and foundations that bring real value to society. And while I could hire experts and start something, what direction should I pursue if I am not confident any of the fields myself? Honestly, I do not just want to be an investor, I want to build things too.

On the other hand, if I became a top researcher or practitioner in a field, I can imagine many more ways to contribute. Maybe along the way I'd find like-minded people to build amazing AI products for society. Maybe some of my research would turn into important work that gets widely adopted-like the Transformers paper (one of the most important breakthroughs in AI history). Maybe I'd even become a professor at a top university, leading others to do great work and pursue their dreams. Of course, like most things in life, luck would play a role. But still, I can see this path as a better route toward greatness.

For those of you who don't care about *"doing great work"* and just want a simple life with a happy family, this might sound silly and idealistic, maybe even childlike. And honestly, you might be right, I am still young with a youthful and "naive" mind. I also think that aiming for a simple family life is a perfectly valid way of living, and I respect anyone who chooses it. (In fact, I'd probably have far less internal conflict if I could have peace to pursue that path, but unfortunately, that's not how my brain works.) I may not be there yet, but I truly believe in what I'm writing.

So I think I will continue on this path: striving to become a great AI researcher, while focusing on helping others along the way. Just like what the Bible commands, I want to love and care for others just as myself and I don't need to be rich to start doing this. I'm also especially concerned about the future of AI, and I hope to help nudge the needle toward safer AI that benefits society as a whole, and not just the rich and elite. I think this is my [**ikigai**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai), my calling in life, and I want to start focusing more fully on it. Looking at people often regarded as *great*: Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jensen Huang, Demis Hassabis, I notice they share certain traits: discipline, focused, strong principles, exceptional mastery of their craft and pursuing things bigger than themselves. Those are the qualities I want to embody as I pursue this journey. There are definitely risks and uncertainties, but in this ever-changing era of AI, **not taking any risks is a risk in itself**.

Well, this is more of a rant and my chain of thought reasoning, but this serves as my personal journal for the future me but hopefully it will be the inspiration for many others too. I want to dedicate my life to living for others. To help, serve, and benefit people. Only when I do this that I can say I am successful. If you disagree with any of the arguments, that is totally okay, and feel free to discuss with me about this, I would love to learn more about others' perspectives. 

For the like-minded individuals out there, believe in what you stand for, find your ikigai, and to not be swayed or distracted by others who have different goals in life. **I think the challenge in life is that there are so many pieces of advice and so much noise out there. We need to learn how to filter them out, focus on what truly matters, and choose to listen to the people we actually aspire to become.** For the Christians out there, remember to always focus on serving others and building God's kingdom and glory, more than our own personal gains. And finally, my last remark: **"If you can do it, then why aren't you solving one of the most important problems in your respective fields?"** :)
