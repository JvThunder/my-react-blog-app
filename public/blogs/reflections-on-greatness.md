Recently, I’ve been contemplating what the best path to achieving greatness really is, especially after seeing people succeed in so many different ways. A lot of people believe that gaining capital as early and as much as possible is probably the best policy in life.

It’s no wonder, then, that many of my smart friends aim for quant companies. Some succeed and end up earning insane amounts of money (for context, the highest salary I know of is around $200k/year even for interns). Sometimes that makes me jealous, and I find myself wondering: why don't I try going for it too? Coming from a background in math and informatics Olympiads, I feel confident that if I dedicated fully grinding for 1-2 years of my life to preparing, I could probably ace the questions and interviews quant companies give, and maybe have a somewhat decent chance of getting onboard (I hope this does not come off as bragging and I only intend to use this for my argument).

But then another part of me starts to question: is this really the best path for me? Is this **really** what I want? For one, I’m not particularly interested in the work quants do. Personally, I don’t think it contributes to society in a very meaningful way. I don’t see myself doing great work directly in that field. Of course, some would argue that with the kind of money you can make, even after just 3-4 years in the quant industry, you could do a lot of good.

So I thought to myself: is it better to be a millionaire with no directly applicable skills, or to become part of the top 0.1% in your field? (Well, technically quants do gain strong skills in low-level programming and financial math, both very difficult, but not so transferable.) Some might choose the former. But I would argue that, when it comes to pursuing greatness, the latter matters more. Just as money can compound, so can skills and expertise.

Even if I had a million dollars now, I am not sure what good I could directly do with it. Sure, I could donate to charity, but that is limited and probably a one-off thing. I could try starting a company, but without deep expertise, I would not really know what kind of business to build. Personally, I lean toward deep tech companies that bring real value to society. And while I could hire experts and start something, what direction should I pursue if I am not confident in the field myself? Honestly, I do not just want to be an investor, I want to build things too.

On the other hand, if I became a top researcher or practitioner in a field, I can imagine many more ways to contribute. Maybe along the way I’d find like-minded people to build amazing AI products for society. Maybe some of my research would turn into important work that gets widely adopted-like the Transformers paper (one of the most important breakthroughs in AI history). Maybe I’d even become a professor at a top university, leading others to do great work and pursue their dreams. Of course, like most things in life, luck would play a role. But still, I can see this path as a better route toward greatness.

For those of you who don’t care about “doing great work” and just want a simple life with a happy family, this might sound silly and idealistic-maybe even childlike. And honestly, you might be right. I also think that this is a perfectly valid way of living, and I respect anyone who chooses it. (In fact, I’d probably have far less internal conflict if I pursued that path-but unfortunately, that’s not how my brain works.) I may not be there yet, but I truly believe in what I’m writing.

**Disclaimer:** *I can write this from a place of contentment. Financially, I feel secure and don’t have external pressure to chase money as quickly as possible. More importantly, I constantly feel the blessings Jesus gives in my life. I believe that whatever I receive-be it power, status, or wealth-ultimately comes from Him and should be used for His glory. Even if I were to become rich, I wouldn’t use money just for myself.*

So I think I will continue on this path: striving to become a great AI researcher. I’m especially concerned about the future of AI, and I hope to help nudge the needle toward safer AI that benefits society as a whole, and not just the rich and elite. I think this is my [**ikigai**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai), my calling in life, and I want to start focusing more fully on it. Looking at people often regarded as *great*: Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jensen Huang, Demis Hassabis, I notice they share certain traits: discipline, focus, strong principles, and exceptional mastery of their craft. Those are the qualities I want to embody as I pursue this journey.

Well, this is more of a rant and my chain of thought reasoning, but this serves as my personal journal for the future me but hopefully it will be the inspiration for many others too. So for those of you who wants to do great work, let us focus on doing what is important and impactful, to not be swayed and distracted by others who have different goals. For the Christians out there, remember to always focus on serving others, and building God's kingdom and glory, more than our own personal gains. "If you can do it now, then why aren't you solving the most important problems the world has to offer?" 

So, for the like-minded individuals out there, believe in what you stand for, I wish for all the best to you, and I hope we can all meet at the top. :)
