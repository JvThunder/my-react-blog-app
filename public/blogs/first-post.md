Hey this is my first post!
I've finally decided to start a blog!

At the time of writing this, I’m a Year 3 student at NTU, studying Data Science and AI. I’m not an expert in AI (yet!), but I believe that sharing knowledge and experiences benefits everyone.

Through this blog, I plan to write about AI-related topics—my thoughts on new research, educational insights, my journey as a student, and more. I see this as a way to improve my ability to explain complex ideas in a simple and accessible manner, stay motivated to keep learning, and contribute to the community. It’s a win-win all around!

In the coming posts, I’ll be sharing more about my journey—how I got started with AI, my research experiences over the past three years, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way.

Hope you enjoy reading my blog!
