I've finally decided to start a blog!

At the time of writing this, I’m a Year 3 student at NTU, studying Data Science and AI. In no way am I an expert in AI (at least not yet!), but I believe that sharing knowledge and experiences benefits everyone.

Through this blog, I’ll be writing about AI-related topics—my thoughts on new research, educational insights, my journey as a student, and more. I see this as a way to improve my ability to explain complex ideas in a simple and accessible way, stay motivated to keep learning, and share my knowledge with others. It's like killing three birds with one stone!

Like many others, I’m still learning and I do make mistakes, so you might disagree with some of my opinions. If you’re interested in discussing them, feel free to reach out—I’d love to exchange thoughts!

In the coming posts, I’ll be sharing more about my journey—how I got started with AI, my research experiences over the past three years, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. In the future, I might also share demos or prototypes of my random ideas, projects, and interesting research!

Hope you enjoy reading my blog and learn something new!
