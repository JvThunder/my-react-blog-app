It was just like any other ordinary day for J. He was in his room, watching something, letting time pass quietly, when a message suddenly came in from N.

“Are you in Indo now?” J replied yes, not thinking much of it. “I just came back from Singapore. Can you help me return V’s key?”

At the mention of V’s name, J paused briefly. The name was familiar. They were from the same high school, and he knew she was N’s best friend. Beyond that, not much. He could not really put a face to the name. She existed in his memory more as a reference than a person.

“Okay, can!” J replied. Coincidentally, he would be flying back to Singapore in a few days anyway. “When can I get it from you?”

“Now? I just arrived at the airport.”

That response caught him a bit off guard. It was already close to midnight, his doors were locked, and the day felt long over. Still, after a short hesitation, J agreed and sent his address. Shortly after, they met. N handed him the keys, along with some snacks. A simple exchange. Nothing more.

J did not know then that this small, almost forgettable favor would quietly change his life. This was early August 2025.

Not long after, V messaged J. They talked a little casually. Though they were from the same high school, they had never really interacted. J still could not picture her clearly, but the familiarity of her name made the conversation feel less distant. They decided to meet over dinner so J could return her keys properly.

A few days later, J flew back to Singapore. They met as planned at JE. J returned her keys early into the dinner, as if completing a simple task. But the dinner did not end there. They stayed. And talked. Three hours passed almost unnoticed.

They talked about many things. School. Mutual friends. Life. J realized he knew many of her classmates, yet somehow never truly knew her. At that time, J was simply enjoying the conversation, hearing new perspectives, learning how she thought. Nothing romantic crossed his mind. He did not think about getting closer to her. He just felt that she was someone interesting, someone who could be a good friend.

After that dinner, they did not talk much. Life resumed its usual cadence. University work took over. Days passed quietly. Two weeks went by.

Then V posted about her capstone project survey. Wanting to help, J messaged her and filled it in. Almost without thinking, he asked if she would like to have dinner together again sometime.

To this day, he is not fully sure why he asked. Maybe he was free. Maybe he remembered how natural the conversation felt. Maybe he simply wanted to continue the connection, however undefined it was.

She did not reply for more than 24 hours. J assumed she was not interested. He accepted it and moved on. But the next day, her reply came. She was interested. J felt a quiet, unexpected excitement. They planned to meet around the CBD area, near V’s internship.

On the day itself, things did not go as planned. V was overwhelmed with work from her internship. He did not want to meet her when she was exhausted, so he suggested postponing the dinner. She agreed, admitting she needed rest too. Before ending the conversation, J asked if they could chat over the weekend instead. She agreed.

That weekend changed everything. They talked for hours on Friday. And again on Saturday. Conversations flowed effortlessly, covering all kinds of topics. Gradually, they moved into deeper discussions about values, principles, and how they viewed life. J shared one of the blogs he had written about his career choices and life values. V read it and shared her thoughts.

That was when something shifted for J. He realized that V was far more interesting than he had initially thought. Thoughtful. Reflective. Surprisingly aligned with how he viewed the world. Curious, he asked more questions. And the more he asked, the more invested he became. Over several days of deep, honest conversations, his feelings quietly grew.

This all happened before they even met for the second time. Eventually, J asked to meet her again. This time, they did. They talked more, laughed more, and things felt different. They continued talkingore afterwards. In early October, J confessed his feelings. V showed her interest too. From then on, they met more often, now aware of their mutual feelings. Dates became warmer, lighter, and more intentional.

By the end of November, after everything they had shared, they decided to date officially. What began as a late-night request to return a key became something neither of them expected, but both came to treasure.
